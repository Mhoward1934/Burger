# Burger

This is an Express application designed to create a list of burgers that are waiting to be devoured!  To begin using the application you will run this code from the terminal with the command… node server.js.  This will connect the application to localhost:8080.  Please be sure you have installed the correct dependencies to run the code.  Once connected you can open the internet browser and type in localhost:8080 which will load the Eat Da Burger application.

At this point the user can enter the type of burger they would like, click “Add Burger” and the burger is added to the “Burger Waiting” list.  Once the burger has been eaten the user can choose the “Devoured” button which will then place the burger in the “Burgers that have been devoured!” list.

The user can also choose to remove (delete) burgers from the “Burgers that have been devoured!” list but clicking the delete button next to the burger.
